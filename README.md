# Spaceship

Final project in Java course. I had to implement BFS and Djikstra's Shortest Path into a GUI in which a spaceship must reach a specific "Planet X" in the shortest time possible, then return back to Earth in the shortest time possible while taking into account paths that may have speedups and other paths which will cause the spaceship to lose health.
